The -m switch allows the user to specify the request methods they are
interested in. Any request that has a method in this list is processed, and all
others are ignored. The string itself is a comma-delimited list of terms.
Spaces are allowed between elements and the terms are not case sensitive. Any
duplicate field names are ignored.

This is the default methods string used:

   options,get,head,post,put,delete,trace,connect

These are all of the default methods listed in RFC2616. If, for example, you
wanted to only process GET and HEAD requests (the default behavior in httpry <=
version 0.1.3) you would use:

   httpry -m get,head

You are not limited to the above list of methods. Any string can be provided
as a potential method, and it will be matched if it appears in a HTTP request.
This allows you to easily search for WebDAV methods, or anything else you're
interested in.

Note that requests and responses are not associated within httpry, as the
program simply displays what it sees on the wire. If you limit the request
types but are capturing traffic both directions, you will still see the server
responses for requests that were ignored.

If you find yourself frequently using a custom method string and don't want to
specify it every run, modify the default method string in config.h and
recompile httpry.

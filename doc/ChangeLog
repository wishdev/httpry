This is the high level list of changes for each httpry release. Note that
this changelog does not include changes to the log file parsing scripts,
which are often updated significantly between releases as well. It only
lists notable changes and fixes to the core httpry program.

version 0.1.4
   * improved efficiency of header line parsing
   * added support for parsing any request method (-m)
   * default to capturing all HTTP packets with a standard RFC2616 method
   * modified date/time stamp to be more consistent with ISO 8601

version 0.1.1
   * fixed some minor format string parsing bugs
   * added debug code to validate correct behavior (use 'make debug' to enable)
   * added packet capture/processing statistics
   * fixed error when changing output file owner after dropping privileges
   * output format structure is now a hybrid tree/list for improved efficiency
   * fixed the header parsing loop continuing into the response data
   * added some additional sanity checks and more informative error strings

version 0.1.0
   * massive code rewrite/refactoring
   * rewrote output format handling code
   * removed config file option
   * removed writing binary dump file
   * removed option to specify run directory in daemon mode
   * changed option letter -f to -r and -l to -f
   * hugely improved the efficiency of packet parsing
   * tweaked default capture filter
   * eliminated some minor memory leaks on shutdown
   * reduced data coupling within the program
   * removed custom argument parser to make it more functional and consistent
   * format string can now have internal whitespace and is now case insensitive

version 0.0.9
   * added parsing of both client requests and server responses
   * default capture filter now less restrictive
   * command line arguments now *always* take precedence over config options
   * wrote custom command line argument parser

   * all major packet fields are now availble for output
   * config file options now all lowercase
   * output files are now chown'd to process owner
   * -n switch now counts parsed packets, not total packets seen
   * additional sanity checking for output file paths

   * allow user to specify fields to output
   * removed extended options switch (-x)
   * configurable output data format (-s)
   * parsed HTTP header fields stored in dynamic list
   * error/log/warn macros encapsulated in header file
   * moved TCP data fields to separate header file

version 0.0.7
   * option to read settings from a config file (-c)

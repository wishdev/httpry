#
# Config file for search_terms.pm
#
# $output_file (required)
#    A valid path to write an output file
#    containing the collected summary data.
#
# %domains (required)
#    A hash containing domain/name pairs to
#    search. The format is self-explanatory;
#    to augment it, simply add the domain and
#    the CGI name of the element to extract
#    the search term.
#
# %ignore (not required)
#    A hash containing domain/regexp pairs to
#    prune from the results list. The regexps
#    are an array of all patterns to match to
#    that particular domain. To ignore all
#    results from a domain, use a regexp of "."

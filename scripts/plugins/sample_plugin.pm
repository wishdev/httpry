# This is an example plugin for the perl parse script parse_log.pl.  It shows
# the basic structure of a simple plugin and provides a good starting point for
# writing a custom plugin. Some of the other included plugins will also provide
# a good idea of how the different pieces work. Each plugin is essentially a
# Perl module dynamically loaded at runtime. A plugin has two required
# functions, new() and main().
